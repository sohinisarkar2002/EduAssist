# EduAssist
This project was originally developed as a group project assignment as part of the Software Engineering course at IIT Madras, where I worked as a member of the backend development team. The goal was to design a comprehensive TA-support platform for IIT Madras BS courses, aimed at streamlining teaching assistance, automating administrative workflows, improving student guidance, and enhancing communication through intelligent tools such as RAG-based assistants, structured workflows, and priority-driven learning aids.

As the project was not fully completed within the course timeline and a demo for that was already given to the examiner for the course, I am now independently extending and enhancing the system, refining existing features, completing pending modules, and improving overall scalability and usability - all with my own ideas and efforts used for the parts that will be newly added henceforth.

Planned improvements will include:
- ✅ Full backend ↔ frontend API integration
- 🔐 Authentication & JWT handling
- 📊 Real analytics for confusion heatmaps
- 🧠 Improved prompt engineering
- 📄 Slide export (PDF / PPT)
- 🧪 Unit & integration tests after all backend and frontend implementations and merging
- 🧾 Role-based access (Educator / Student)
