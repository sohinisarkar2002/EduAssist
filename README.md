# EduAssist
Being a current BSc student at IIT Madras, trying to design a comprehensive TA-support platform for IIT Madras BS courses to streamline teaching assistance, automate administrative tasks, enhance student guidance, and improve communication through intelligent tools like RAG-based assistants, structured workflows, and priority-driven learning aids.

EduAssist is an AI-powered teaching assistant platform designed to help educators create high-quality content, engage students more effectively, and reduce repetitive administrative work.

⚠️ Project Status: This project is currently under active development. Some features are partially implemented or use mock data. The roadmap below outlines what is planned next.

🌐 Live Demo: https://eduassist-nine.vercel.app/

✨ Why EduAssist?
    Educators spend a significant amount of time on:
    Preparing study materials
    Creating assessments
    Explaining complex topics repeatedly
    Managing feedback and administrative tasks
    EduAssist aims to centralize and automate these workflows using AI — so educators can focus on teaching, not tooling.
